*Port of winpdb-reborn to Python 3 / WxPython 4 is work-in-progress. There are still some rough edges.*

*Winpdb Reborn - A GPL Python Debugger, reborn from the unmaintained
Winpdb*

by Philippe Fremy as maintainer, and Nir Aides as initial author

Website: https://github.com/bluebird75/winpdb 

# Description

*Winpdb Reborn* is a portable (Windows / Linux / macOS) standalone graphical debugger for Python. It focuses on making debugging
easy and does not include any IDE features. It has very little dependencies (only wxPython for the GUI).

**Features**:

- graphical interface with stack/variable inspection, breakpoints and more
- breakpoints: on lines or functions, with possible conditions, load/save breakpoint info
- multi-threaded debugging
- smart handling of fork, follow parent or child
- remote debugging: GUI on one computer, program to debug on another computer with encrypted communication
- up to 20 times quicker than pdb, the default Python debugger (on which many other debuggers are built)
- debug PyPy scripts

**Note:** The original Winpdb was no longer maintained since the v1.4.8 release in
2010. With the agreement of the author (Nir Aides), I (Philippe Fremy) am providing a maintained version with new
functionality under the *Winpdb Reborn* name.

# Requirements

Platform supported:

-  Linux
-  Windows XP and above
-  macOS is probably working but not tested

To run Winpdb Reborn:

- CPython 3.5 or above and wxPython 4

This version is for Python 3 only. A stable version of Winpdb for Python 2 is available on PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/winpdb-reborn/1.5.0/ and in the branch *winpdb-reborn-python2* . You will need Python 2.7 and WxPython 3 to run it.

Note that running Winpdb with PyPy is possible, by launching rpdb2.py with ``pypy`` and using the Winpdb GUI to connect to it.

Winpdb Reborn is NOT compatible with Jython or IronPython.

# Installation

(not working yet until the new version is released).

The standard way to install Winpdb Reborn is with pip, as administrator/root::

    # python -m pip install winpdb-reborn

You must also install the wxPython for your version of Python: 

-  for Python 3, wxPython is automatically installed as a dependency with pip
-  for Python 2, check https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/

*Winpdb Reborn* is not packaged yet by any Linux distro. If your package manager proposes
to install Winpdb, that’s the old unmaintained Winpdb which works neither with Python 2.7 nor with Python 3.

## Additional installation methods

To install from a checkout or from an archive::

    # python setup.py install -f

## No install mode

If you don’t want to install Winpdb Reborn, you can still try it by calling it explicitly with
your program to debug::

    $ python /the/path/to/winpdb.py my_program.py 

## Where do the files go ?

The setup script copies rpdb2.py and winpdb.py modules to the Python
site-packages folder. The scripts rpdb2 and winpdb are copied to the
Python binaries (scripts) folder. On Linux, this folder is usually ``/usr/bin`` 
and is in the path by default. On Windows, this folder is ``%PYTHONHOME%\Scripts``,
where you should see a winpdb.exe and rpdb2.exe .


# Usage

If you have installed Winpdb Reborn, the simplest way to launch it is::

    $ python -m winpdb my_program.py

or even::

    $ winpdb my_program.py

Find out about the other command-line options with ``–-help`` .

# Documentation

Use the ``-h`` or ``--help``  command-line flag for command-line help.

Inside Winpdb/Rpdb2 console, use the ``help`` command for detailed description of
debugger commands.
